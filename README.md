Project Description: App is designed to pull gifs from giphy.com using their API and display them to the user. Additionally, user can choose to animate gifs by clicking.

Functionality: Single search bar where specific searches can be input by user. List of "hot topic" quick search links. "Trending" button to see the top 15 currently trending gifs.

Technologies Used: .html, .css, .js, bootstrap

Ideas for future improvement: Sizing is something of an issue on smaller screens. Would like to try to figure out how to have all of the gifs in uniformly sized containers for help with transitioning from larger to smaller screens. Could have a click event for each gif where it brings the user to the original source page for the gif.
